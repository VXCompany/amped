# Welcome to Amped!

## Meet Amped: "Your connection to curated content"

Amped's main goal is to help with access to curated content. Users are encouraged to contribute, consume and rate all kinds of content: (e)books, blogposts, links, videos, courses, etc.

### What does it do?

Amped allows content to be catalogued, rated and shared. But it also serves a second goal: learning by doing! As we are building "Amped" as an app (and hopefully as a small community), we show you all the steps along the way! You will get insight in how the idea got formed and what we did to get where we are. We will be writing about it in blogposts, organizing meetups on related topics, doing live coding sessions, etc.

### Why?

This project started as input for our meetup content and a nice demo app (no more "Hello World!"). As we were designing the demo app, we acknowledged a common struggle: there is so much content for software people out there, how do we manage it all? Avoid "content overload" and still keep on learing? Meet Amped: "Your connection to curated content"
