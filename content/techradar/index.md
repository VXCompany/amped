# Tech Radar

On this page we will list concepts, technniques, languages, frameworks and tools used within Amped. As Amped evolves, so does this list. This means that not every item on the list is necessarily still part of the (main) codebase. 

## Svelte

We needed a simple way to quickly create an interactive UI. Angular, React and Vue were discussed but we decided to go for a newer "kid on the block". 

Things we liked about Svelte:

- Less code needed compared to Angular or React;
- Easy to setup, easy to get started;
- Centered around components and we liked that a lot!

Things that were a bit rough with Svelte:

- We were not sure if we needed SvelteKit so we started with plain Svelte. Maybe we will need to move to SvelteKit later on.
