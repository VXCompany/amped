# Mob programming session: Modeling the domain

> Mob programming is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. This is similar to pair programming where two people sit at the same computer and collaborate on the same code at the same time. With mob programming, the collaboration is extended to everyone on the team, while still using a single computer for writing the code and inputting it into the code base. - Wikipedia

This video is a recording of a mob programming session from November the 18th. Due to covid restrictions we had to do the session with Microsoft Teams. Content is in Dutch.
