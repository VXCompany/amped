## Context
Shelly is really enthousiastic about Amped and she wants to share it. But because Yuri created such a weird URL for Amped, nobody can find it. We can't change the URL because reasons. So the next best thing is allow users to send an e-mail to their friends via Amped, in which they  invite their friends to start using Amped.

## Acceptance criteria
* A user can specify the recipient of the invitation-email.
* The e-mail contains some text
* Robots can not abuse this form (maybe make it available for authenticated users only/add a captcha/use a feature flag)
