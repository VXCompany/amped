## Context
As the name implies, Parker likes to create bookmarks. Amped is not supposed to be used once. We hope people keep coming back to our sites/apps. And when they do, they should see their own list of bookmarks.

## Acceptance criteria
* To create bookmarks, users need to authenticate
* Users Authenticate with Google only (for now..)
* The website shows the name of the person who logged in.
* When a bookmark is created, we save the bookmarker his subject-id
* When the user logs in, he sees his/her list of bookmarks
